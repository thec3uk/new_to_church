# Eco Church at C3

<div style="text-align: center;">
	<br>
	<em>The earth is the&nbsp;Lord’s,&nbsp;and everything in it,<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the world, and all who live in it;</em><br>
	&nbsp;
</div>

<div style="text-align: right;">
	Psalm 24:1 (New International Version)<br>
	&nbsp;
</div>

Here at C3 we believe that the earth is the Lord’s, that He made it ‘very good’, and that he wants us to look after it well. We believe that it was created by Jesus and for Jesus (<em>Colossians 1:16</em>) and that God’s grand plan of salvation will ultimately include the whole of creation (<em>Colossians 1:19-20</em>). We intend to turn those beliefs into something practical and tangible.

In February 2017 C3 was presented with its Bronze Eco Church award. <a href="https://ecochurch.arocha.org.uk/" target="_blank">Eco Church</a>&nbsp;is <a href="http://arocha.org.uk/" target="_blank">A Rocha UK’s</a>&nbsp;award scheme for churches who want to demonstrate that the gospel is good news for God’s earth. Getting the bronze award wasn’t too tricky – getting silver and gold will be harder. We will, for example, be looking at our use of printed materials and our approach to travel.

We also have strong connections with Foxearth Meadows Nature Reserve on the Essex/Suffolk border. This is A Rocha UK’s only owned nature reserve.

If you would like to be involved in any of our Eco Church initiatives, we would love to hear from you. Please get in contact with the (group here)[https://thec3.churchsuite.co.uk/groups/orynixwk]
