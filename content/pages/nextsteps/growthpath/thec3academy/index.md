At C3 we are devoted to raising and equipping leaders for all spheres of life. The C3 Academy is our highly successful year-long leadership programme, with full-time and part-time options.<br/>

The course is a fantastic way to explore your potential as a leader within the church as well as providing opportunities for personal development in many other ways.<br/>
<br/>
We have made it as flexible as possible to study so there’s bound to be an option that works for you. It will provide you with a wealth of scriptural knowledge as well as the chance to serve in many capacities.<br/>

The C3 Academy runs from September to July. If you’re interested in knowing more about leadership and how you can grow in this area then visit the<a href="http://www.journeyacademy.co.uk"> C3 Academy</a> website for more details.<br/>
