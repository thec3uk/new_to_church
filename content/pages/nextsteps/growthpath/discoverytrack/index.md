<h1>
<span>Growth Path Step 1: Discovery Track </span></h1>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Discovery Track is the first step in the C3 Growth Path and is the best way to discover the values behind The C3 Church and how you can get connected. Spread over four sessions you will hear about the heart and soul of our church, have time to ask questions, meet some of the leadership team, and have the opportunity to join the C3 family.</p>

<p>
Discovery Track is now available to attend in two different formats:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Four sessions over four weeks on Sundays after the 11:30 service (this course includes lunch and the option for Kids Discovery)</li>
<li>
Four sessions in two consecutive midweek evenings (including refreshments)</li>
</ul>
