<h1>
Westminster Theological Centre</h1>
<br/>
C3 believes in equipping disciples to excel and lead in their homes, churches and the market place.<br/>
 <br/>
We have, therefore, partnered with WTC, to form the Cambridge Hub, a dynamic learning community in which you will enjoy the very best biblical scholarship combined with the dynamic power and gifts of the Holy Spirit.<br/>
 <br/>
WTC delivers a variety of <a href="https://wtctheology.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/WTC-Prospectus-2018_download.pdf" target="_blank">part-time courses</a> in Kingdom Theology including BA(Hons) and MA.<br/>
 <br/>
All these courses are delivered on a part-time evening basis in the Cambridge Hub so students can study whilst remaining in employment. You can find out more at our Cambridge Hub Open Day. Use the form below to register:<br/>
