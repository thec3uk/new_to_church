<h1>
Growth Path Step 3: Leadership Track</h1>
<br/>
The C3 Leadership Track is the third step in the our <a href="/nextsteps/growthpath/">Growth Path</a>, following <a href="/nextsteps/growthpath/discoverytrack/">Discovery Track</a> and <a href="/nextsteps/growthpath/deepertrack/">Deeper Track</a>.<br/>
<br/>
As part of your growth at C3 we are passionate about seeing everyone fulfil the potential God has placed within them.  We believe that as Christians, we are all called to be influencers in our worlds, whether that is the world of education, business or family, to name but a few.  How we use that influence is all about leadership.<br/>
 <br/>
The Leadership Track is an opportunity for anyone who is on team in C3 to explore leadership further.  It involves two parts; 101 and 102.  <br/>
<br/>
In Leadership Track 101 we look at areas such as leading others, looking after yourself, vision and goal-setting.<br/>
<br/>
For those keen to go to the next level, Leadership Track 102 involves leadership huddles and exploring some key books and topics vital to leadership.<br/>
<br/>
C3 Leadership Track is for members of the C3 family currently serving on one of our teams. If you are not yet on a team, why not find out more on the <a href="/nextsteps/c3teams/">C3 Teams</a> page? If you are interested in starting your leadership journey with us, we recommend attending our <a href="/nextsteps/growthpath/discoverytrack/">Discovery Track</a> course where you can learn more about our vision and values.<br/>
