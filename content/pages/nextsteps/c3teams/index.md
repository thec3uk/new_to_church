# Come and be part of Team C3!

C3 teams are made up of a group of incredible people that use their gifts and passions to serve God in the church. There is a place for everyone to serve in our diverse C3 teams.

Joining Team&nbsp;C3 is a great way to make a real difference in the lives of others while building great friendships. Serving is one of the best ways in which we demonstrate our love for God and people.

If you are interested in joining Team&nbsp;C3 we recommend attending our [Discovery Track](/nextsteps/growthpath/discoverytrack/), part of the C3 [Growth Path](/nextsteps/growthpath/). This course will teach you more about our values and vision here at C3.
