<h1>
    Ascend Men at C3</h1>
<br />
Ascend Men has a vision to see men challenged, inspired and equipped to live passionate lives for Jesus in all areas of life. We meet regularly throughout the year for fellowship breakfasts, occasional guest speaker evenings and for fundraising events.<br />
<br />
The men&#39;s breakfast is a great opportunity to take some time out for fellowship, eat delicious food and hear some inspirational stories and teaching, all for the low cost of &pound;5!&nbsp; Each men&#39;s breakfast has a guest speaker brought in for the occasion and are held at the C3 Centre.
