<em>'For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago' </em></div>

<br/>
Breathe exists to champion women from all walks of life.  We believe that every woman matters and has a unique contribution to make to this world. Inspired by our Christian faith, our core aim is to encourage, equip and empower women to be the very best they can be.<br/>
<br/>
We believe our united journey is even stronger since we are better together!<br/>
<br/>
There are so many opportunities to connect with women of all ages at C3 and beyond, making new friends, and being encouraged and inspired in our faith.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the year we run a number of events designed to bring women together; our key ministry areas can be found below. To find out more about what's coming up, you can find us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/breathewomenministries/">Facebook</a> or follow our blog on the <a href="https://breathe.thec3.uk/">Breathe Website</a>.
