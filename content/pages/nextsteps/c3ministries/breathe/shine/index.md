<h1>
Empowering women to live in confidence</h1>
<br/>
SHINE is an interactive course that gives space for women to learn, reflect and share thoughts on their value, convictions, hopes and dreams.<br/>
<br/>
Through exploring the key concepts of Worth, Strength and Purpose women are challenged and encouraged to discover that beauty, potential and value are intrinsic and not reliant on the world’s opinion of them.<br/>
<br/>
SHINE is so much more than a confidence-boosting course – it is a tool that transforms lives and equips women to live to their full potential.<br/>
<br/>
From the 2018 delegates, 97% said Shine had impacted them personally and were able to give specific examples and elaborate on this. 85% said Shine had equipped them to make a difference in their world. <br/>
<br/>
We run the Shine Course in two ways; as an evening class and as an intensive weekend. Upcoming courses when available can be booked from this page.<br/>
<br/>
We have 3 courses planned for 2019. Please check back here for booking details.<br/>
7 week course: Starting 3 June<br/>
Shine Experience (weekend): Fri 1 March/Sat 2 March; or Fri 11 October/Sat 12 October
