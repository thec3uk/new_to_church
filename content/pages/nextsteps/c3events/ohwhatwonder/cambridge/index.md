Christmas at C3 this year is bigger than ever before. Join us for our Christmas concerts as we explore the Christmas story through the eyes of multiple characters and sing some of your<br/>
favourite carols like you never have before! There will be Kids Church for all kids, I heard they have some donkeys visiting! It’s going to be an interactive and entertaining celebration so bring your family and friends.  </p>
