# Bringing C3 closer together

C3 Groups have a simple purpose, bringing people closer to God and each other. We believe God created us to live in community, only then can we experience the full life He intends for us.

#### C3 Group Leader Interest Form

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We are passionate about seeing new groups started each term, because each new group represents a fresh opportunity for those who are currently unconnected to find their place to belong in the C3 family.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We would love to find out more about your ideas for C3 Groups. We provide training&nbsp;for all potential group leaders so if you are not certain what your group may look like, please still fill in the form and look out for a 'next steps' email.
