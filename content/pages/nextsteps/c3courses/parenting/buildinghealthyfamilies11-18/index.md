<h1>Building Healthy Families</h1>

<br>
The&nbsp;<strong>Building Healthy Families (aged 11-18 years)&nbsp;Course</strong>&nbsp;is for individuals in every type of parenting situation including lone parenting, step-parenting and parenting as a couple. The Parenting Teenagers Course is based on Christian principles but designed for all couples with or without a church background.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Over five sessions, the course will help you to equip your teenager for life by looking at the following areas:
<ul>
	<li>
		Keeping the End in Mind</li>
	<li>
		Meeting our Teenagers’ Needs</li>
	<li>
		Setting Boundaries</li>
	<li>
		Developing Emotional Health</li>
	<li>
		Helping Them Make Good Choices</li>
</ul>
Each session begins with refreshments, giving you space to relax and chat to other parents/carers and the course leaders. This is followed by a DVD presentation and finishes with time for discussion about the issues raised in small groups.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The DVD presentation includes street interviews, filmed clips of parents and children sharing their own experiences and advice from parenting experts.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are interesting in joining the next course, please use the form below to book in:<br>
