<h1>Building Healthy Families</h1>
<br>
The&nbsp;<strong>Building Healthy Families&nbsp;(aged 0 â€“ 10 years) Course</strong>&nbsp;is for individuals in every type of parenting situation including lone parenting, step-parenting and parenting as a couple. The Parenting Children Course is based on Christian principles but designed for all couples with or without a church background.<br>
<br>
Over five sessions, the course will help you to:
<ul>
	<li>
		Build strong foundations</li>
	<li>
		Meet your children's needs</li>
	<li>
		Set clear boundaries</li>
	<li>
		Teach healthy relationships</li>
	<li>
		Consider your long-term aim</li>
</ul>
Each session begins with refreshments, giving you space to relax and chat to other parents/carers and the course leaders. This is followed by a DVD presentation&nbsp; and finishes with time for discussion about the issues raised in small groups.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The DVD presentation includes street interviews, filmed clips of parents and children sharing their own experiences and advice from parenting experts. If you are interested in attending the next course, please book in here:<br>
