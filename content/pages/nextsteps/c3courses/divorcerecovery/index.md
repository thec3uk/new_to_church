<h1>
Divorce recovery courses at C3</h1>
<br/>
This course is designed to help you recover from the pain of separation and move towards rebuilding your life. It is suitable for anyone, whether they have experienced separation or divorce recently, or at any time in the past. Set in a relaxed, friendly and supportive environment, each session begins with a talk on a divorce-related subject, followed by a discussion in small groups.<br/>
<br/>
Privacy is respected, there is no requirement for you to disclose anything about your relationship, however, many participants find this is one of the most helpful parts of the course.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Divorce Recovery is relevant for anyone with or without a Christian faith or church background.</strong><br/>
<br/>
The course runs for six weeks with a break for half-term. Each evening begins with a talk, with opportunities for discussion in small groups. The small groups are led by people who have gone through divorce themselves. The setting is welcoming, relaxed and unthreatening.<br/>
<br/>
