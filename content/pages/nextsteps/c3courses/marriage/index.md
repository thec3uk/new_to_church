<h1>
Building strong foundations for the future</h1>
<br/>
Whether you have been together 1 year or 60 years, the C3 Marriage Courses are the perfect opportunity to spend quality time with your spouse or partner whilst also learning some of the tools that make a great relationship.  <br/>
<br/>
Created by Holy Trinity Brompton Church, the courses are DVD-based and interspersed with time and space for couples to discuss the material in private. Whilst based on Biblical principles, our Marriage Courses are relevant for any couple with or without a Christian faith or church background.<br/>
