<br/>
The Marriage Preparation Course is a series of six sessions for couples who are exploring the idea of getting married and for those who are already engaged. It’s designed for those who want to give their marriage the best possible start, whether they’re exploring marriage for the first time or have been married before.<br/>
<br/>
The C3 Marriage courses are based on material developed by Nicky and Sila Lee, authors of The Marriage Book. This course will help you to learn to communicate well, understand and appreciate your differences, and prepare for potential challenges. <br/>
<br/>
This course is run by host couples in their own home, times can be arranged to suit your individual schedules.  Each evening will begin with a meal followed by practical DVD presentations and a times for private discussion between you and your partner. You are never asked share anything private about your relationship with anyone other than your partner, but your host couple will be available for advice and to share stories from their experiences. <br/>
