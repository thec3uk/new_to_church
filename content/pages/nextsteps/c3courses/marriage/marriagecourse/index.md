<h1>
Strengthening the bond</h1>
<br/>
The Marriage Course is a series of 7 sessions, designed to help couples invest in their relationship and build a strong marriage.<br/>
<br/>
Developed by Nicky and Sila Lee, authors of The Marriage Book, this course is designed for couples looking to build strong foundations, learn to communicate more effectively and resolve differences well. It offers essential tools and practical ideas to help you build a relationship that lasts a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
Based on Christian principles this is relevant for all couples with or without a church background.<br/>
<br/>
Each couple will have their own table and each session will include; a dessert, a practical DVD presentation and a time for private discussion between you and your partner. You are never asked to share anything about your relationship with anyone other than your partner.<br/>
<br/>
Why not invest this time as a date night to help you take your marriage to the next level? To attend our next upcoming course, please book your tickets below.
