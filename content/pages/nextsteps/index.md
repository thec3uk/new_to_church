# Next Steps

At the C3 church it is our heart to empower you to take the next step. We want you to be able to go further in your relationship with God and become a leader in your sphere.&nbsp;

We want to encourage everyone to discover the wide open spaces where people can flourish into all that God has called them to be. Our <a href="/nextsteps/growthpath/">Growth Path</a> helps you to discover your potential and deepen your spiritual practices, <a href="/nextsteps/c3groups/">C3 Groups</a> are a great place to develop life-changing relationships with other members to grow your faith and serving on a <a href="/nextsteps/c3teams/">C3 Team</a> allows you to support others who are taking their first steps with Christ.

Our <a href="/nextsteps/c3ministries/breathe/">women&#39;s</a> and <a href="/nextsteps/c3ministries/ascendmen/">men&#39;s</a> ministries are designed to help you grow closer to God by meeting your needs through focused discussion and teaching.
