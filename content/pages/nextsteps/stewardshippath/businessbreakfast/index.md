<h1>
Establishing God's kingdom in the workplace</h1>
 

<div style="text-align: justify;">
There are many Christians in the marketplace who hold strategic positions in business, education and politics; the C3 Business Breakfast group meet every month to offer fellowship and mutual support in the development and exploration of the call to minister in and transform the workplace.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to find out more about how to move in your anointing and to help others hear the word of God within your own place of work, our Business Breakfast is open to all. We meet monthly on the first Friday of every month, from 7:00am to 8:30am at the C3 Centre. <br/>

Our next meeting is on Friday 7 December with guest speaker Tim Pilkington.
