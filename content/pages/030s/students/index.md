# C3 Students

If you are new to the city and have visited C3 in the last few weeks or know someone who you think would like to attend, there are lots of <a href="/Calendar/Month.aspx">upcoming events</a> and groups designed to help you connect and make you feel at home.

If you would like to find out more about us, read through our [New to Church](/newtochurch/gotquestions/) common questions and consider attending our [Discovery Track](/nextsteps/growthpath/discoverytrack/) to help you understand our vision and values and connect with other members.

Our [Young Adults](/030s/youngadults/) group meets every&nbsp;Wednesday during term time for stripped-back worship, thought-provoking message and Bible-based discussion groups.

If you would like to get in touch with us, we would love to hear from you! <a href="http://thec3.us7.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=0d5a663576589488ee65a7ec4&amp;id=6112a88305" target="_blank">Fill in this form</a> and someone from the team will be in contact.
