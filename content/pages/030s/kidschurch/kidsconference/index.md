# Creating community for parents, guardians and children

Our Toddler Drop-In group runs every Wednesday morning during term time from 10:00am to 11:30am.

All parents and carers are invited to come, grab a coffee and let your little one play, listen to stories and sing. There is a cost of &pound;1 per child which can be paid on the morning, there is no need to book in advance.

If you would like to find out more about our Toddler Drop-In or would be able to spare some time to volunteer, please fill in the form below and one of the team will be in touch.<br />
