# Empowering the younger generation

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br />
Kids Church is for ages 0-11 years old and meets every Sunday at all 3 services, take your pick from 9:30, 11:30 or 17:30!<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">
WELCOME TO KIDS CHURCH!</h3>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br />
The safety and security of your child in our care is our primary focus so our registration and check-in process reflects that. On your first visit head to the Connect Lounge where one of our Kids Team will be there to help you register and sign up for Kids Church. You will be asked to provide your contact details and any information regarding special requirements your child may need. We have an SMS system in place should we need to alert you during the service. The details and information collected will be stored in our secure database to facilitate our electronic check-in and out system. All of our volunteers on team in Kids Church pass safeguarding and DBS checks before starting on team.<br />
<br />
Once registered your child will be allocated to a Kids Church group based on their school year:</div>

<br />
Every Sunday service also offers a Parent &amp; Baby Live Link where parents can enjoy a tea or coffee on the sofa&nbsp;whilst watching a live link of what is happening in&nbsp;the auditorium. The room has a range of baby toys and mats so both guardian&nbsp;and child can enjoy the service!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We want to empower and equip Kids as best we can to explore their faith in a fun and engaging environment. Kids Church at C3 is full of great teaching, worship, fun team games and creative craft activities.<br />
<br />
We also use the free YouVersion app, use it to develop your family discipleship journey with bible studies and discussion questions that are kid-friendly and linked to the lessons they learn on Sundays. We want to encourage faith conversations around the table and give you the tools to be instrumental in growing your kids&rsquo; relationship with God!<br />
