<h1>
C3 Kids Conference</h1>
<br />
Everybody loved it last year, so&nbsp;we&#39;re doing it again!&nbsp;C3 Kids Conference is happening and it&#39;s happening soon!<br />
&nbsp;
<h3 style="text-align: center;">
26 January 2019 | 10am - 4pm | The C3 Centre</h3>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br />
It&#39;s that time of year again, we get to take over the C3 Centre with your kids and have a day full of games, music, teaching, crafts, inflatables, face painting and more. To guarantee the best day with us send your kids dressed as your&nbsp;favourite&nbsp;superhero!<br />
<br />
This day promises to inspire and engage your kids in their faith, we believe nothing is impossible with Jesus&rsquo; supernatural power within us, we just need to have&nbsp;courage&nbsp;and be brave enough to use it for good and for God! We believe Jesus came to save the world and that God has given us all special gifts we can use as our superpowers, it&rsquo;s going to be an INCREDIBLE day as we discover the power within us and teach your kids what it is for!<br />
<br />
Lunch, drinks&nbsp;and&nbsp;snacks will be provided for the day, so be sure to let us know of any dietary requirements your child may have.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
We would love for your kids to bring their friends along to join in the fun, so start to think about who you can invite and make the most of the early bird offer!</div>
