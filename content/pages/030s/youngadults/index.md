# C3 Young Adults

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br />
If you&#39;re between the ages of 18&ndash;30 then C3 Young Adults is for you! In addition to regular socials and special events, we meet every Wednesday during term time.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Come along at the C3 Centre, 7.30 - 9.30m for a time of stripped-back worship, a thought-provoking message and Bible-based discussion groups.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Whether you&#39;re new to the city, recently joined C3, or been around forever, this is a great opportunity to&nbsp;connect&nbsp;with others and deepen your relationship with God in a relaxed and relevant environment.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
