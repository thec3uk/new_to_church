# Welcome to C3 Youth!

We fully believe we are chosen by God to live a faith-filled life that is fun, radical and authentic.

**We meet at the C3 centre every Friday night from 19:00 to 21:00 in term time.**

Friday nights are a place where we meet as family in our Lifegroups, have laughter and fun and grow in our radical faith with Jesus.

At C3 Sunday services we gather as youth family #FrontAndLeft to worship Jesus. After worship and during the service, school years 7 to 9 are welcome to join SHIFT Sundays, these meetings create an opportunity for young people to hear and discuss great teaching, have fun and grow their faith.

If you have any questions about C3 Youth we would love to hear from you. Find us on (Facebook)[https://www.facebook.com/thec3youth/] or fill in the form below and one of the team will be in touch.
