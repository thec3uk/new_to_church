	As an Abolition group, we exist to support the work of <a href="/Articles/510531/Hope_for_Justice.aspx">Hope for Justice</a> as they seek to end modern slavery by preventing exploitation, rescuing victims, restoring lives and reforming society.<br>
	<br>
	<em>“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world, it’s the only thing that ever has.”</em></div>

	We Educate</h3>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
	<br>
	By developing our own understanding of human trafficking and raising awareness in our community and beyond.<br>
	&nbsp;</div>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">
	We Fund</h3>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
	<br>
	More resources mean more freedom! The money we raise helps to fund rescues and after care to those who have suffered brutal exploitation.<br>
	&nbsp;</div>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">
	We Act</h3>
<br>
Prayer is powerful, we pray for the work of Hope for Justice and for victims and survivors. We contribute to campaigns to raise awareness and reform society.
