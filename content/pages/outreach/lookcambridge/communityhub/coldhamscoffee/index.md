# But first, coffee...

Coldhams Coffee is located in the C3 Centre and offers cold and hot drinks made from the highest quality ethically sourced, locally roasted coffee beans. In addition to providing a wide range of coffees, Coldhams has a selection of cold drinks, sandwiches, snacks and locally made desserts.
