<h1>
It's all about community</h1>
<br/>
At the C3 we are passionate about reaching and shaping the community around us. <br/>
<br/>
Relationships play a key role in helping people in society who are vulnerable or feel isolated. Open Lunch café provides a safe and friendly space for the community to meet and grow while serving warm, tasty and low-cost meals made from excess food donated by local businesses.<br/>
<br/>
Open Lunch runs every Friday, offering lunch in two sittings, at 12 pm and 1 pm. This is a part of our <a href="/Articles/510506/Community_Hub.aspx">Community Hub</a> and all are welcome. Lunch is donation based, just pay what you can.<br/>
<br/>
