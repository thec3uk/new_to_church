# Easing the struggle of learning to read

Read Easy offers a free, friendly, flexible approach to learning to read for any adult who either canâ€™t read at all, or who lacks confidence with reading.

C3 works in partnership with Read Easy as a part of our [Community Hub](/outreach/lookcambridge/communityhub/) outreach program. Volunteers are recruited, trained and supported to give one-to-one tuition to adults in need in the community.

If you feel you would benefit from the Read Easy program or are passionate about volunteering your time to assist others in the community, please fill in the form below and our Community Team will be in touch
