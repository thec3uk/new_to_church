<h1>
Good food, good conversation, great community!</h1>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
Wednesday Lunch Club brings older adults together to enjoy a hot nutritious meal and socialise with friends at the same time.<br/>
 <br/>
The meal is just one part of the lunchtime experience. It's a social occasion as much as it is a nutritional one.<br/>
 <br/>
Wednesday Lunch club runs from 12:30 to 13:30 as part of our <a href="/Articles/510506/Community_Hub.aspx">Community Hub</a>. All are welcome and lunch is donation based, just pay what you can.<br/>
 <br/>
If you have questions about attending this or our <a href="/Articles/510575/Open_Lunch_Cafe.aspx">Open Lunch</a> on Fridays, you can fill in the form below or contact the Community Team directly at the C3 Offices on 01223 844415.<br/>
 <br/>
The Wednesday Lunch Team are passionate about making positive change in the community. If you feel you could share your talents by volunteering at Community Hub, please get in touch with us using the form below.</div>
