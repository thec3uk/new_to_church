<h1>
The local church is the hope of the world</h1>
<br/>
Our objectives are to help alleviate poverty, reduce isolation, strengthen community and build community capacity. We believe that through community initiatives, lives are being changed and people are experiencing acceptance and love on a regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.coop.co.uk/membership/local-community-fund">Our local Co-operative store has selected LOOK Cambridge to be a ‘Local Cause’</a>. This means that every person who selects us as their charity, enables us to share in 1% of the Co-op's takings. From now until October 2018, every purchase will help us to continue the great work that happens at the Friday Hub.<br/>
<br/>
If you are a Co-op member, why not select Cambridge Community Church as your charity of choice! For those of you who are yet to become a member of the Co-op, please <a href="http://www.coop.co.uk/membership">consider joining</a>.
