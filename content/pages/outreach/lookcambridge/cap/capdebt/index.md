<h1>
Freedom from the burden of debt</h1>
<br/>
In partnership with C3, CAP Cambridge Central has specially trained debt coaches who will visit clients in their own homes and work with them to gather the paperwork that is required by the debt counsellors at CAP head office in Bradford. <br/>
<br/>
The trained debt counsellors will then work out a realistic budget that prioritises essential bills. They will negotiate affordable payments with each creditor and attempt to stop unfair interest and charges where possible. Our Debt Coach will then explain the budget and the payments the client  will need to make. <br/>
<br/>
At C3 we have a wider team of befrienders who walk alongside the client as they journey to become debt free.  We are passionate about loving people back to life when they have experienced debt, trauma and rejection.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>For an appointment, please call CAP Head Office on 0800 3280006</strong><br/>
