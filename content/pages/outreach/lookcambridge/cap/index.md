# Working together to release people from poverty

Christians Against Poverty exist because nobody should be held hostage by debt and poverty. CAP and C3 are passionate about releasing people in our nation from a life sentence of debt, poverty and their causes

C3 works in close partnership with Christians About Poverty to provide the CAP Cambridge Central Debt Centre.

Alongside the Debt Centre, C3 also offers other CAP services at the C3 Centre. Find out more about the services available on the pages below.
