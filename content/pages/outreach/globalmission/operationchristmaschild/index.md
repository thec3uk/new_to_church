<h1>
Opportunities to begin a journey of faith</h1>
<br/>
A small shoebox can have a big impact. What goes into the box is fun, but what comes out of it is eternal.<br/>
<br/>
After receiving a shoebox gift, children have the opportunity to enrol in The Greatest Journey - 12 fun and interactive Bible lessons, where they get the chance to discover who Jesus is and how to begin their own journey of faith. Operation Christmas Child is an initiative of <a href="https://www.samaritans-purse.org.uk/">Samaritan's Purse</a>.<br/>
<br/>
C3 are pleased to be a drop off location for OCC shoeboxes. Although the campaign for 2017 is now complete you can still keep in touch to follow the story by visiting the <a href="https://www.samaritans-purse.org.uk/what-we-do/operation-christmas-child/">Operation Christmas Child </a>website.<br/>
