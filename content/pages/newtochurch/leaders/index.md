#### Pastors Steve and Angie Campbell

</br>

Steve and Angie moved to Cambridge in 1994 to lead the C3 team. As Senior Pastors they have led C3 into an influential, pioneering church known for its worship, teaching and generosity.

**Steve** has taught in many different contexts throughout the UK and beyond. He works closely with a number of different streams and churches teaching and advising on his greatest passion, the local church. As a gifted communicator, Steve has a conviction to change the perception of church and loves to challenge people’s mindsets of what church should be.

Steve is an avid table tennis fan and will take on anyone who’s willing to challenge him!

**Angie** has many years of experience teaching in a variety of different circles. Qualifying as a teacher in 1986 and teaching Maths for a number of years she has only continued to develop her skills, particularly within the area of psychometric testing. Angie is a qualified LifeThrive Professional, a system that has helped shape many areas of C3 within the last few years.

Angie loves to launch new initiatives and ministries. As part of this Angie has been instrumental in setting up Cambridge City Foodbank, Breathe Ministries, LOOK Cambridge and many more!

Overall, Steve and Angie have a deep conviction that “people really matter” and this fuels everything they do in the local church.
