<h4>
	Christ Centred</h4>
We seek to be Spirit led and Bible based<br/>
Our goal is to make disciples of Jesus Christ<br/>
Jesus was extravagantly generous. Heâ€™s our example.
<h4>
	<br/>
	Cause Driven</h4>
Lost people matter to God and therefore to us.<br/>
To honour God and value people we aim for excellence in all we do.<br/>
We seek to exemplify passionate spirituality.
<h4>
	<br/>
	Community Focused</h4>
We seek to honour all people<br/>
We aim to show grace to everyone.<br/>
Community is important and having fun is contagious<br/>
