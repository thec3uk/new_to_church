Our values shape our culture and determine our behaviour</h1>

<h4>
<br/>
We value lost people</h4>
<br/>
<em>For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.</em>

<div style="text-align: right;">
John 3:16 (NIV)<br/>
 </div>
<em>The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.</em>

<div style="text-align: right;">
2 Peter 3:9 (NIV)<br/>
 </div>
Lost people matter to God and therefore matter to us.  We are committed to reaching people who don’t yet know Jesus Christ. Growth is not an optional extra but a commitment whilst there are still people far away from God in our world. This of necessity involves preaching the gospel but it also involves acts of kindness and serving the poor and disadvantaged.

<h4>
<br/>
We value making disciples</h4>
<br/>
<em>...and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age</em>

<div style="text-align: right;">
Matthew 28:20 (NIV)</div>

<div>
<em>Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful. And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another - and all the more as you see the Day approaching</em>.</div>

<div style="text-align: right;">
<span style="text-align: right; font-size: 1.8rem;">Hebrews 10:23-25 (NIV)</span></div>
<br/>
Conversion is the beginning of the story not the end because we are called to make disciples who obey everything Jesus taught. Disciples are learners, apprentices of Christ who are continually growing and developing as fully devoted followers. Our goal is to present every person mature in Christ.  No one thrives in an atmosphere of negativity and therefore encouragement is key to developing disciples. Our goal is to build ‘big people’ who flourish in the house of God, playing their part and making a difference in the community.
<h4>
<br/>
We value Word and Spirit</h4>
<br/>
<em>For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword,it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.</em>

<div style="text-align: right;">
Hebrews 4:12 (NIV)</div>
<br/>
<em>All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness</em>

<div style="text-align: right;">
2 Timothy 3:16 (NIV)<br/>
 </div>
We believe the bible is alive and active and that all scripture is God-breathed.  We are dependent upon the power and presence of the Holy Spirit to fill and empower believers to be effective witnesses, fruitful followers and essential members of the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12).

<h4>
<br/>
We value excellence</h4>
<br/>
<em>People were overwhelmed with amazement. “He has done everything well,” they said. “He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak</em>

<div style="text-align: right;">
Mark 7:37 (NIV)</div>
<br/>
God is a God of excellence who does all things well. Therefore, when we engage in excellence we reflect him.  Excellence is not about perfectionism but rather being and doing the best we can with the resources God has entrusted to us. Excellence matters because people matter and because we want to give our best to God.
<h4>
<br/>
We value passionate Christianity</h4>
<br/>
<em>Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters</em>

<div style="text-align: right;">
Colossians 3:23 (NIV)</div>
<br/>
<em>Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord</em>

<div style="text-align: right;">
Romans 12:11 (NIV)<br/>
 </div>
Passionate Christianity is normal. The bible is clear that ‘whatever’ we do we are to do it with all our heart.  Jesus was passionate for the house of God, as we should be. Nothing great is ever achieved without passion and passion is persuasive. We are to “never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervour serving the Lord”. This affects how we serve, sing, worship, speak and act. This passion will be expressed in many and various ways and will always overflow in to our corporate worship.

<h4>
<br/>
We value having fun</h4>
<br/>
<em>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness</em>

<div style="text-align: right;">
Galatians 5:22 (NIV)</div>
<br/>
<em>Nehemiah said, “Go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks, and send some to those who have nothing prepared. This day is holy to our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the Lord is your strength</em>

<div style="text-align: right;">
Nehemiah 8:10 (NIV)</div>
<br/>
Joy is a natural consequence of being a Christian. The Kingdom of God is about righteousness, peace and joy. Joy gives us energy and sustains us on the journey. Cheerfulness helps us stay healthy: “A cheerful heart is good medicine”.
<h4>
<br/>
We value generosity</h4>
<br/>
<em>For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also</em>

<div style="text-align: right;">
Luke 12:34 (NIV)</div>
<br/>
<em>The righteous care about justice for the poor,<br/>
    but the wicked have no such concern.</em>

<div style="text-align: right;">
Proverbs 29:7 (NIV)</div>
<br/>
Generosity reflects God’s nature. He is a generous giver. Our heart will follow where we place our treasure and thus we encourage people to give of their time, treasure and talents to C3. Giving to those who can never repay us is a way of life required of all God’s people. Justice for the poor and giving to the poor are essential concerns for all Christians.
<h4>
<br/>
We value community</h4>
<br/>
<em>The Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him</em>

<div style="text-align: right;">
Genesis 2:18 (NIV)</div>
<br/>
<em>God sets the lonely in families,<br/>
    he leads out the prisoners with singing;<br/>
    but the rebellious live in a sun-scorched land.</em>

<div style="text-align: right;">
Psalm 68:6 (NIV)</div>
<br/>
God’s answer to Adam’s aloneness was community.  God places the lonely in families. We all need a place to belong, where we are accepted and part of the family. C3 is a family. We need each other and everyone has a part to play. There is no such thing as an insignificant member of the body of Christ and we believe every member is a minister. Each person’s gift(s) are discovered, developed and deployed for the benefit of the whole, and none of us can be our best without each other.
<h4>
<br/>
We value honour</h4>
<br/>
<em>that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.</em>

<div style="text-align: right;">
John 5:23 (NIV)</div>

<div>
<br/>
<em>then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind.</em></div>

<div style="text-align: right;">
Philippians 2:2 (NIV)</div>
<br/>
We live to honour God. We are also instructed to give honour where it’s due to our fellow man. Lack of honouring will restrict what we receive from someone.  Correctly honouring releases faith and our ability to fully receive from others. Honour swims against the flow of envy and competition as we ‘in humility consider others better than yourselves…”. We think the best way to honour people is to serve all and encourage often.
<h4>
<br/>
We value grace</h4>

<div>
<br/>
<em>Out of his fullness we have all received grace in place of grace already given.</em></div>

<div style="text-align: right;">
John 1:16 (NIV)</div>
<br/>
<em>For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—</em>

<div style="text-align: right;">
Ephesians 2:8 (NIV)</div>
<br/>
Every human being is made in the image and likeness of God and therefore worthy of respect and dignity. Grace accepts people without necessarily approving of their actions. Grace takes the initiative to reach out to others different to ourselves. By grace we are saved and grace sustains us through life. Therefore grace will be present in our preaching, relationships and attitudes as a hallmark attribute for all who call C3 their home.<br/>
