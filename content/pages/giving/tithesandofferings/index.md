# Tithes &amp; Offerings

_Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver_

<p style="font-size: 1.8rem; text-align: right;">2 Corinthians 9:7 (NIV)</p>

The Bible teaches us that we worship the Lord with our tithe, which is ten percent of our income contributed to the church on a regular basis. When we feel called to give over and above our tithe, we do so as an offering.
