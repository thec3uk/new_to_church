# Vision Offering

_Therefore go and make disciples of all nations,&nbsp;baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,&nbsp;and teaching&nbsp;them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you&nbsp;always, to the very end of the age._

<p style="text-align: right;">Matthew 28:19-20 (NIV)</p>

Offerings to this fund advances the mission of C3 of&nbsp;Reaching and Shaping a generation with the message and cause of Christ. The vision offering goes beyond our daily running costs in order to enable us to fulfil the commission that God has placed on our hearts.
